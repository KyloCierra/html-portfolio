<h1>Kenny's Most Awesome Movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 favorite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>A heartwarming, evocative coming-of-age story about a girl struggling with unfamiliar territory after her family decides to move to a new city.
    I really love all the emotions and especially connect with Sadness!
</p>
<h3>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</h3>
<p>
    This is my favorite Star Wars movie! Rian Johnson is an iconoclast, actively smashing down the symbols
    that were set up in the prequel to this movie. It's very subversive and I'm all for it. I think it would
    work well as a non-Star Wars movie too, but the idea of the potential of breaking free from
    the symbols of Star Wars (the masked villain smashing his mask, the fact that Luke Skywalker chucks the lightsaber
    into the sea, and introducing Rose Tico, who in any other movie would be no one of note) is exciting to me
    because I love the conclusion: that the Force can be wielded by anyone.

    I didn't like that Finn's storyline of a Stormtrooper who defects, has a conscience, and WIELDS
    A LIGHTSABER AGAINST KYLO REN wasn't further explored though.

<h3>Die Hard</h3>
<p>A fantastic Christmas movie, all about holiday cheer and the value of family.</p>
