  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I've always been interested in learning how to program games, and I've also always feared
    that it would be too difficult. My earliest memories were of playing Excite Bike on a Taiawnese
    NES. I started learning programming at an early age (QBASIC) but I got horribly distracted and never
    properly learned. <br />
    <br />
    Fast forward to my late thirties. Technology has developed far more and YouTube and Udemy
    exist too. Knowledge is <i>really easy</i> to come by. But I still haven't learned how to create programs.
    I always thought, "Man, I wished I had the dedication to just sit down and learn coding properly."
    So, with that, I decided I would take a web development course on Udemy and learn how to create
    web pages, and hopefully interactive pages with JavaScript.<br />
    <br />
    I also love art and graphic design, and dreamed of an interactive comic experience with music
    that would play in the background too (this website exists now, WebToons).<br />
    <br />
    There's so much out there to learn, and it's rather overwhelming. The world seems kind of 
    crazy right now, with AI on the horizon as a huge unknown, the fear of a looming 
    economic downturn and general unkindness to humans who <i>aren't like us</i>.
    <br />
    <br />
    I definitely got sidetracked there. Maybe I have ADHD?
